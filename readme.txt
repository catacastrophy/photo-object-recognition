In order to run the program, you firstly need to download the missing file yolov3.weights, which you can download from this link:

You also need to install some requirements, by simply running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Afterwards, you can use the photo that is already in the repository, or upload your own.
Make sure to either rename the image to "image.png", or if you don't want to change the name, then change the code to use the name of your photo.
Have fun!
